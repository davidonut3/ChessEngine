Optimising get_all_possible_moves:

get_possible_moves stores the moves for a specific piece in a Vec, benching this gives:

Min duration 8.1µs
Max duration 21.7µs
Average duration 11.008µs

Switching to an array based approach gives:

Min duration 6.5µs
Max duration 19.6µs
Average duration 9.006µs

We see a slight improvement, which might stack up as many calls to get_all_possible_moves have to be made.
