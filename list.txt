Others:

- load images before running, instead of reloading them during running
- add types like `type Bitboard = u64;` to fenlib for clarity
- optimise fenlib (most String -> u64 have been done, but we can still always optimise)

Possible optimizations for bots and fenlib:

- Store possible moves and change dynamically in move_to_fen
- Precompute attacked and defended bits in fenlib to speed up get_possible_moves
- Switch eval system to bits instead of 'regular' computation
- Remove promotion flag from move to save space
- Use binary search to find pieces on board

Code quality:

- Add custom types to rust files
