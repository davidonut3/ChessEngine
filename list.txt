Others:

- load images before running, instead of reloading them during running
- add types like `type Bitboard = u64;` to fenlib for clarity
- optimise fenlib (most String -> u64 have been done, but we can still always optimise)
- make custom LargeMove ([u128; 3], good for speed, bad for memory) and SmallMove (u16, bad for speed, good for memory) structs in fenlib

Possible optimizations for bots and fenlib:

- Switch eval system to bits instead of 'regular' computation
- Remove promotion flag from move to save space
- Use binary search to find pieces on board

Code quality:

- Add custom types to rust files
- Reverse rank order to comply with chess logic
