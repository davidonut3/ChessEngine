Others:

- load images before running, instead of reloading them during running
- add types like `type Bitboard = u64;` to fenlib for clarity
- optimise fenlib (most String -> u64 have been done, but we can still always optimise)

Currently:

- make botv1

Possible optimizations for bots and fenlib:

- Store possible moves and change dynamically in move_to_fen
- Precompute attacked and defended bits in fenlib to speed up get_possible_moves
- Switch eval system to bits instead of 'regular' computation

Code quality:

- Add custom types to rust files
